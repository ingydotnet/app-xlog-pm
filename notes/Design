= Design

- XLog is a way to "Web Log" anything: thoughts, ideas, stories, photos,
  document.
- XLog is built over CogBase and git.
- XLog is run using CogApp.
- An XLog repository contains 4 branches.
  - master (aka export)
  - cogbase
  - cogapp
  - gh-pages (for static site run from github)
- XLog is edited/configured/updated/maintained from the command line
- Each thought/etc is a cog node
- Each type of node has a schema node
- Each node has a 4 digit, human friendly id.
- The XLog itself has a similar id.


= xlogger.org
- A site for hosting of xlogs. 
- xloggers can comment on other xloggers content.
